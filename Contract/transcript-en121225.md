### **Accepted Contract Manufacturing Cases**

# **III. Application Q&A Common Questions**
**TFDA Medical Device Contract Manufacturing Zone**
*   **Applicable Targets and Scope**: Domestic medical device firms entrusting domestic or foreign medical device manufacturers to execute one of the specified contract manufacturing procedures must apply for medical device contract manufacturing.

### **Source (Continued Q&A)**

# **Common Questions**
*   Medical device contract manufacturing applications must be submitted by the **entrusting party**, and each case is limited to **one entrusted party**.
*   There is **no quantity limit** for the items applied in the case.
*   Entrusting only packaging, labeling, or partial processes that **do not involve "transforming materials, substances, or components into medical devices"** does not require application for medical device contract manufacturing.
*   Parent/subsidiary companies (O/P), acting as an agent for foreign products, or entrusting the manufacturing of components/parts are **not considered contract manufacturing** and do not require application.
*   If contract manufacturing is already registered on the original medical device permit, the contract manufacturing application must be completed before any changes occur (change of manufacturer name/address) and **before applying for permit renewal**.
*   When there is a change in the medical device contract manufacturing situation, changes to the registration items of the related medical device permit or registration must be applied for individually after the contract manufacturing application or change is completed.
*   Except for items exempted from manufacturing permit (Article 22, Paragraph 2 of this Act), the **entrusted party must first obtain a Medical Device Manufacturing Permit (QMS/QSD)** before the entrusting party can apply for medical device contract manufacturing.
*   The Medical Device Manufacturing Permit (QMS/QSD) should cover **all items and processes** intended for contract manufacturing application.
