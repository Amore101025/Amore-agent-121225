### Opening Remarks

Good morning everyone, and welcome to the 2025 “Medical Device Contract Manufacturing Online Application System” Case Application Workshop, organized by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration.

Today’s session is designed primarily for domestic medical device firms, as well as domestic agents representing foreign manufacturers, who are planning to entrust or accept the manufacturing of medical devices under Taiwan’s Medical Device Act. Our goal is to help you clearly understand the **legal requirements, application procedures, system operations, and common pitfalls** related to medical device contract manufacturing.

Our workshop is structured into three main parts:

1. **Explanation of the “Operating Guidelines for Medical Device Contract Manufacturing.”**  
2. **Case Application Demonstration using the Online Application System.**  
3. **Common Q&A and Practical Clarifications.**

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to determine:

- Whether your planned activity is considered “contract manufacturing” under the law.  
- Which documents you must prepare.  
- How to correctly submit an online application from start to finish.  
- How to avoid the most frequent reasons for supplements or rejection.

Let’s begin with Part I: an explanation of the **Operating Guidelines for Medical Device Contract Manufacturing**.

---

## I. Explanation of the “Operating Guidelines for Medical Device Contract Manufacturing”

### 1. Legal Basis

The **Operating Guidelines for Medical Device Contract Manufacturing**, promulgated on **April 15, 2021 (Minguo 110.4.15)**, are issued under the authority of the **Medical Device Act**.

The key legal basis is **Article 23 of the Medical Device Act**, which states in essence:

- A **medical device manufacturer** shall not entrust the manufacturing of medical devices to another manufacturer, and shall not accept such entrusted manufacturing, **without the approval of the central competent authority**, which is TFDA.
- A **medical device seller** is generally **not allowed to manufacture medical devices**. The sole exception is when the seller has received approval from the central competent authority to **entrust the manufacturing** to another medical device manufacturer.

In other words, if you are:

- A **manufacturer** wanting to outsource some or all of your manufacturing operations to another manufacturer, or  
- A **seller** wanting to have products manufactured on your behalf by a manufacturer,

you **must** obtain TFDA approval for contract manufacturing before such activities are legally carried out.

### 2. Definition of “Contract Manufacturing” (Article 2)

Article 2 of the Guidelines provides a precise definition of **contract manufacturing**.

Under these Guidelines, **“contract manufacturing”** means:

> The act of a **medical device firm** entrusting another **medical device manufacturer** to perform either:
> - the **entire process** listed in Article 10, Paragraph 1 of the Medical Device Act, or  
> - only the **manufacturing** or **sterilization** procedures.

Article 10, Paragraph 1 of the Act defines the regulated procedures as:

1. **Manufacturing**  
2. **Packaging**  
3. **Labeling**  
4. **Sterilization**  
5. **Final release**

When a medical device firm entrusts:

- **All of the above procedures** (manufacturing, packaging, labeling, sterilization, and final release) to another medical device manufacturer, this is referred to as the **“entire process”** contract manufacturing.
- Or, entrusts **only the manufacturing operation** or **only the sterilization operation** (while other parts are done elsewhere or by the firm itself), this is still considered **contract manufacturing** and requires TFDA approval.

A key point is that **contract manufacturing always involves a medical device manufacturer as the entrusted party**. Merely asking a logistics provider to package products, or a print shop to print labels, is not contract manufacturing if those parties are **not medical device manufacturers** and the activities do not involve transforming materials into medical devices.

### 3. Scope of Application – Three Types of Processes

Under the Guidelines, an application is required in **three specific types of contract manufacturing scenarios**:

1. **Entire Process**  
   - All of the following steps are entrusted to the same manufacturing facility:
     - Manufacturing  
     - Packaging  
     - Labeling  
     - Sterilization (if applicable)  
     - Final release  
   - This is common when a **medical device seller** has no production line and fully outsources the entire production to a manufacturer.

2. **Manufacturing Only**  
   - This refers specifically to the **operation of transforming materials, substances, or components into medical devices by physical or chemical methods**.  
   - It may or may not include packaging, labeling, or sterilization. Even if those are performed by the same factory, the critical regulated portion is the **transformative manufacturing step**.  
   - If a medical device firm entrusts **only this transformative step** to another manufacturer, an application is required.

3. **Sterilization Only**  
   - When a medical device firm entrusts **only the sterilization operation** to another medical device manufacturer, this also requires an application.  
   - Common sterilization methods include:
     - EO (Ethylene Oxide)  
     - Gamma irradiation  
     - Electron beam (E-beam)  
     - Moist heat (steam)  
     - Other methods as specified.

If you are only entrusting tasks such as **packaging and labeling**, and these tasks do **not** involve transforming materials into medical devices, **you do not need to apply** for contract manufacturing under these Guidelines.

### 4. Application Documents (Article 3)

According to Article 3, a medical device firm applying for contract manufacturing must:

- Fill out the **Application Form**,  
- Attach the required documents and information, and  
- Pay the **application fee**.

The required documents include:

1. **Name and address of the entrusting party and the entrusted party**  
2. **Contract Manufacturing Agreement** between both parties  
3. **Classification and grading items** of the medical devices subject to contract manufacturing  
4. **Manufacturing process** that will be entrusted  
5. **Rights and obligations** of both the entrusting party and the entrusted party

For administrative purposes, TFDA further distinguishes whether the entrusted party is **domestic** or **foreign**. The main documentation requirements are:

| Item | Description | Entrusting Domestic Manufacturer | Entrusting Foreign Manufacturer |
| ---- | ----------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1 | Medical Device Contract Manufacturing Application Form | Required | Required |
| 2 | Entrusting Party’s Medical Device Firm License | Required | Required |
| 3 | Entrusted Party’s Medical Device Firm License | Required | Not required |
| 4 | Entrusted Party’s Medical Device Manufacturing Permit (QMS/QSD)\* | Case-by-case | Case-by-case |
| 5 | Contract Manufacturing Agreement (signed) | Required | Required |

\* If the medical device is classified as **exempt from manufacturing permit** under Article 22, Paragraph 2 of the Act, the entrusted party’s manufacturing permit may be exempt.

### 5. Required Content of the Contract Manufacturing Agreement (Article 4)

The **Contract Manufacturing Agreement** is a critical document in the review process. It must clearly state:

1. **Names and addresses** of the entrusting party and the entrusted party  
2. **Entrusted items and processes** of the medical device  
3. **Classification and grading items** of the medical devices involved  
4. **Manufacturing process** that is being entrusted  
5. **Rights and obligations** of both parties

For online applications, you must upload a **color PDF** or **ZIP** file of the signed agreement. The file must clearly show:

- Full **names and addresses** of both parties  
- The scope of **contract manufacturing** (entire process, manufacturing, or sterilization)  
- **Device classification codes and classes**  
- Detailed description of **manufacturing/sterilization processes**  
- Defined **responsibilities** (e.g., quality, documentation, adverse event reporting, recall responsibilities)  
- **Signatures or seals** of the legal representatives of both parties

Applications are **often delayed** when the agreement is incomplete, lacks signatures, or does not explicitly cover all entrusted items and processes.

### 6. Approval Registration and Enforcement Date (Article 5 & 10)

Once approved, the contract manufacturing relationship is formally **registered** by TFDA.

- The Guidelines took effect on **May 1, 2021 (110.5.1)**.  
- All contract manufacturing activities from that date onward are subject to these requirements.

If your existing medical device permit already indicates contract manufacturing arrangements, you must ensure that **any subsequent changes** (e.g., manufacturer name/address changes, permit renewal) are aligned with the current contract manufacturing approval. In many cases, a **contract manufacturing application or change** must be processed **before** filing a permit change or renewal.

### 7. Who May Apply – Seller vs. Manufacturer Scenarios

The **applicant for contract manufacturing** is always the **“entrusting party”**, i.e., the medical device firm that is outsourcing the manufacturing or sterilization.

There are a few typical scenarios:

| Entrusting Party Status | Allowed Contract Manufacturing Activities |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Holds **Seller License** | May apply for **entire process**, **manufacturing**, or **sterilization** contract manufacturing |
| Holds **only Manufacturer License** | May apply for **manufacturing** or **sterilization** contract manufacturing |
| Holds **only Manufacturer License**, but wants to apply for **entire process** | **Not allowed** until a Seller License is obtained |

A key rule is:

> A firm that only holds a **“Medical Device Manufacturer Permit License”** cannot directly apply for **entire process** contract manufacturing. It must first obtain a **“Medical Device Seller Permit License”**.

Therefore, before planning an entire-process outsourcing model, please carefully review your current **license type** and sequence your regulatory steps correctly.

### 8. Examples Involving Sterilization Operations

Let’s look at a few example scenarios:

1. **Case 1 – Seller entrusting entire process**  
   - Entrusting party: **CCC Glasses Co., Ltd.** (Medical Device Seller)  
   - Entrusted party: **DDD Optics Co., Ltd.** (Medical Device Manufacturer)  
   - Application type: **Contact lens – entire process contract manufacturing**  

   Here, CCC Glasses Co. holds a seller license and may apply to entrust **all steps**, including manufacturing, packaging, labeling, sterilization, and final release, to DDD Optics.

2. **Case 2 – Manufacturer entrusting entire process to another manufacturer**  
   - Entrusting party: **DDD Optics Co., Ltd.** (Manufacturer)  
   - Entrusted party: **BBB Technology Co., Ltd.** (Manufacturer)  
   - Product: Intramedullary nail system  
   - Application: **Entire process** contract manufacturing  
   - Sterilization:
     - **Option 1:** Sterilization is performed directly by BBB Technology.  
     - **Option 2:** BBB further entrusts sterilization to **EEE Company**.

   In practice, if sterilization is subcontracted to a third manufacturer (EEE), this relationship also needs to be **properly reflected and approved** in the contract manufacturing structure.

3. **Case 3 – Seller applying for entire process for unspecified manufacturer**  
   - Entrusting party: **AAA Medical Device Co., Ltd.** (Seller)  
   - Application type: **Entire process** contract manufacturing  
   - Entrusted party: To be specified in the application.

4. **Case 4 – Seller applying for sterilization-only contract manufacturing**  
   - Entrusting party: **CCC Glasses Co., Ltd.** (Seller)  
   - Application type: **EO ethylene oxide sterilization contract manufacturing**  
   - EO sterilization is entrusted to a medical device manufacturer that holds the relevant QMS/QSD and sterilization capabilities.

When applying for **sterilization-only** contract manufacturing, TFDA **recommends applying for all device items** that use that particular sterilization process, to avoid fragmented or repeated applications. If you only apply for **specific codes**, you should select **“Other”** and list those codes explicitly (e.g., “L4022, N4210 applicable to Gamma sterilization”).

### 9. Items Exempt from Manufacturing Permit

On **July 1, 2021 (110.7.1)**, TFDA announced a list of items that are **exempt from the Medical Device Manufacturing Permit**, **provided that they are not sterilized**.

Examples include:

- **A.1660 – Quality control material (assayed and unassayed), Class I**  
- **A.2270 – Thin-layer chromatography system for clinical use, Class I**  
- **B.1850 – Dye and chemical solution stains, Class I**  
- **C.2600 – Wood’s fluorescent lamp, Class I**  
- Multiple **dental and otologic instruments** such as:
  - Dental diamond instruments  
  - Dental hand instruments  
  - Prophylaxis cups  
  - Rubber dams and accessories  
  - Disposable fluoride trays  
  - Intraoral dental wax  
  - Earphone cushions for audiometric testing  
  - Ossicular replacement prosthesis modification instruments  

If a product is on this exempt list **and is not sterilized**, the **entrusted manufacturer does not require a manufacturing permit** for that item. However, **contract manufacturing approval may still be required** depending on whether manufacturing or sterilization operations are being entrusted.

The key is to distinguish:

- **Manufacturing permit exemption** (for certain low-risk, non-sterile Class I items), versus  
- The separate requirement to obtain **contract manufacturing approval** for any **entire process, manufacturing, or sterilization** entrusted to another manufacturer.

## II. Case Application Demonstration – Online Application System

We now move to Part II: a practical demonstration of the **“Medical Device Contract Manufacturing Online Application System”**, accessible at:

> **https://mdcm.fda.gov.tw**

### 1. Login Methods

The system supports **certificate-based login**, primarily:

1. **Commercial/Industrial Certificate IC Card**  
   - This is the **main login method** for domestic firms.  
   - You **do not need to pre-apply for a separate user account**.  
   - When you first log in with your Commercial/Industrial Certificate, the system will automatically bring you to the **Account Settings** page.

2. **Natural Person Certificate IC Card / NHI IC Card (Optional)**  
   - These are **non-mandatory** login methods.  
   - They can be associated with the Commercial/Industrial Certificate, allowing specific staff members to log in on behalf of the company.  
   - Prior setup in the system is required to enable a Natural Person or NHI IC Card.

3. **Foreign Manufacturer Account**  
   - For foreign medical device manufacturers acting as the **entrusted party**, an account must be set up.  
   - The registration information typically includes:
     - Account name  
     - Company name  
     - Person in charge  
     - Company phone  
     - Foreign address and country  
     - Domestic agent’s name, phone, email  
     - Domestic agent company name and uniform ID or agent ID number  
     - **Authorization letter** upload

Foreign manufacturers are not required to hold a domestic firm license, but they must have a valid account and work through a **domestic agent**.

### 2. Application Workflow

Once logged in, the **entrusting party** follows these steps:

1. **Select Case Type**
   - Choose **New Case Application** or **Change Application** from the system interface.

2. **Fill in Application Information**
   - Enter the **entrusting party’s** information (which should match the firm license).  
   - Select or enter **entrusted manufacturer information**.  
     - Note: The **entrusted manufacturer must already have an account** in the system.

3. **Upload Required Documents**
   - Upload the **Medical Device Firm Licenses** (seller or manufacturer, as applicable).  
   - Upload the **QMS (QSD) approval** information for domestic operators:
     - Select: Not applicable / Exempt from manufacturing permit / Applicable  
     - If applicable, enter:
       - QMS approval number  
       - Expiration date  
       - Upload the approval file  
   - Upload the **Contract Manufacturing Agreement** (PDF or ZIP).

4. **Select Contract Manufacturing Process**
   - Choose one of the three process types:
     - **Entire process** (all procedures per Article 10, Paragraph 1 performed by one facility).  
     - **Manufacturing** (without necessarily including packaging/labeling/final release in the application).  
     - **Sterilization** (select EO, Gamma, E-beam, Moist heat, or Other).
   - For sterilization:
     - TFDA recommends that if many products share the same sterilization method, **apply for all relevant items at once** for efficiency.  
     - If applying only for specific items, choose **“Other”** and specify codes (e.g., “L4022, N4210 for Gamma sterilization”).

5. **Online Payment**
   - Online payment is **mandatory**.  
   - There are **five** payment methods:
     1. Financial card / Bank account transfer  
     2. Payment at Bank of Taiwan counter  
     3. ATM payment (about 1–3 days to be credited)  
     4. Credit card payment (about 2–3 days to be credited)  
     5. Convenience store payment (about 7 days to be credited)
   - The system will first ask you to **“Generate Payment Slip Number”**.  
   - You must complete payment **within 10 days**.  
   - After payment, **do not repeatedly refresh** if the status still shows “expired”; the crediting takes **3–7 working days** depending on payment type.

6. **Submit Application**
   - **Very important:** After the system confirms funds are credited, you must manually click **“Submit Application”**.  
   - Many applicants mistakenly assume that payment alone completes the application. However, **only after clicking “Submit Application”** does the case move to the official status of **“Applying”**.

### 3. Case Management Interface

Within the system, you will see several key sections:

- **Tabs for Case Status:**
  - Draft  
  - Applying  
  - Supplementing Documents  
  - Closed  
  - Approved Cases  

- **Buttons:**
  - **New Case Application**  
  - **Change Application**

The **Account Management** area allows you to:

- Add a **main account** and **sub-accounts**.  
- Maintain contact information (email, company phone, contact person).  
- Enable or disable individual user accounts.  
- Configure **Natural Person or NHI IC Card** associations for named staff.

### 4. Change Applications

A **Change Application** is used when there is a change in an existing contract manufacturing relationship, such as:

- Change of **entrusted manufacturer**,  
- Change in **scope of entrusted processes** (e.g., adding sterilization),  
- Change in **device items** under the contract.

The system will ask for:

- Existing **Contract Manufacturing Approval Number**  
- Entrusted manufacturer  
- Type of process (Entire process, Manufacturing, Sterilization)

You will need to update and re-upload the **Contract Manufacturing Agreement** and any other affected documents to reflect the new situation.

### 5. Review Timeline and Supplementation

Once submitted, the TFDA review process is as follows:

- **Document review period:** up to **90 days**.  
- If the documents and information are **compliant**, TFDA issues an **approval**.  
- If they are **not compliant**, TFDA will issue a **notification to supplement documents** with a deadline of **3 months**.
  - After you submit the requested supplements, TFDA performs another review.  
  - If compliant, the case is approved.  
  - If still not compliant, the case is **not approved**.

To minimize supplements:

- Ensure **consistency** between:
  - Firm licenses  
  - QMS (QSD) scopes  
  - Contract Manufacturing Agreement  
  - Application form entries  
- Confirm that all device **codes and classes** in the application match those in the agreement and, where applicable, the QMS scope.

### 6. Application Volume Statistics

From 2021 to 2025, TFDA has observed a steady volume of contract manufacturing applications:

- **New applications** per year:  
  - 2021: 323  
  - 2022: 557  
  - 2023: 356  
  - 2024: 445  
  - 2025: 445 (up to the time of reporting)

- **Change applications**: 43 (2021) → 113 (2022) → 46 (2023) → 56 (2024) → 14 (2025)  

- **Revocation applications** remain low, generally in single digits per year.

This reflects a **maturing regulatory environment**, with many firms gradually aligning their outsourcing structures with the statutory requirements.

## III. Application Q&A – Common Questions

In the last part of our workshop, we will address **frequently asked questions** and clarify some borderline cases.

### 1. Who Must Apply?

- **The entrusting party** must submit the contract manufacturing application.  
- Each application is limited to **one entrusted party**.  
- However, within one case, there is **no limit on the number of product items** included, as long as they share the same entrusting/entrusted relationship and process scope.

### 2. When Is It *Not* Considered Contract Manufacturing?

The following are **not** considered contract manufacturing and **do not require applications** under these Guidelines:

- Entrusting **only packaging or labeling**, where the work does **not involve transforming materials, substances, or components into medical devices**.  
- Parent/subsidiary company relationships (O/P) where the activity does not constitute a regulated contract manufacturing relationship under the Act.  
- Acting purely as an **agent for foreign products**, where the foreign manufacturer is responsible for manufacturing under its own jurisdiction and TFDA recognizes that manufacturer via the product registration path.  
- Entrusting the manufacturing of **components or parts** that are not yet medical devices in their own right, and where no regulated manufacturing of a finished medical device is being carried out.

### 3. Relationship with Existing Medical Device Permits

If your existing **medical device permit** already lists a contract manufacturing relationship:

- When changes occur, such as manufacturer name/address changes, or when you apply for **permit renewal**, you must ensure that the **contract manufacturing approval** is updated first.  
- In many cases, you will need to:
  1. Complete a **contract manufacturing new or change application**; then  
  2. Submit the **medical device permit change or renewal** application, referencing the updated contract manufacturing approval.

### 4. QMS / QSD Requirements for Entrusted Parties

Except for items **exempt from manufacturing permit** (Article 22, Paragraph 2 of the Act), the **entrusted party must first hold a valid Medical Device Manufacturing Permit (QMS/QSD)** before the entrusting party can apply for contract manufacturing.

Furthermore:

- The QMS/QSD must **cover all device items and processes** intended to be included in the contract manufacturing application.  
- If the QMS scope is narrower than the entrusted scope, TFDA will ask for clarification or reject the application.

### 5. Online Consultation and Support

For additional assistance, TFDA provides an online consultation service:

- **Medical Device Contract Manufacturing Online Consultation Platform**  
- **Executing Unit:** Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)  
- **Contact Person:** Mr. Wu Jun-yan  
- **Hotlines:** 03-5732043, 03-5743868

## 20 Comprehensive Follow-Up Questions

1. How are borderline activities—such as minor assembly plus packaging—evaluated to determine whether they constitute “transforming materials into medical devices” and thus require a contract manufacturing application?  
2. In multi-party supply chains where one manufacturer performs sub-assembly and another performs final integration, how should the entrusting/entrusted relationship be structured and documented for TFDA purposes?  
3. What best practices can firms adopt when drafting Contract Manufacturing Agreements to minimize the likelihood of TFDA requesting supplements or clarifications?  
4. How does TFDA handle scenarios where the entrusted party’s QMS/QSD scope partially overlaps but does not fully cover all devices or processes listed in the contract manufacturing application?  
5. When a foreign manufacturer acts as the entrusted party, how are inspections, QMS verifications, and post-market obligations coordinated between TFDA, the foreign party, and the domestic agent?  
6. How should firms manage contract manufacturing approvals when a single device family shares multiple sterilization methods (e.g., EO and Gamma) used for different SKUs or markets?  
7. What are the most common errors or omissions TFDA encounters in online contract manufacturing applications, and how can applicants systematically check for these before submission?  
8. How does TFDA expect firms to handle temporary changes in contract manufacturing arrangements (e.g., emergency capacity transfers) within the existing approval framework?  
9. In practice, how should firms align the timing of contract manufacturing change applications with upcoming medical device permit renewals to avoid delays or regulatory gaps?  
10. For items exempt from manufacturing permits, what factors does TFDA consider when assessing whether a particular contract manufacturing arrangement still requires an approval?  
11. How are quality responsibilities (nonconformities, CAPA, recalls) expected to be allocated between entrusting and entrusted parties within the Contract Manufacturing Agreement from a regulatory compliance perspective?  
12. What mechanisms exist for TFDA to monitor ongoing compliance of approved contract manufacturing relationships, and what documentation should firms maintain for audits?  
13. How should a firm manage multiple concurrent contract manufacturing approvals for the same device with different entrusted manufacturers (e.g., dual sourcing strategies)?  
14. What specific data fields and file naming conventions does TFDA recommend for uploaded documents to facilitate efficient review and reduce the risk of misinterpretation?  
15. How does TFDA view the role of digital signatures and electronic seals on Contract Manufacturing Agreements uploaded via the online system—are there specific technical or legal requirements?  
16. In the context of risk management, how should firms incorporate ISO 14971 or similar frameworks into their decision-making about outsourcing manufacturing or sterilization steps?  
17. How do contract manufacturing approvals interact with other regulatory pathways, such as device registration, listing updates, or post-market change notifications?  
18. What are the recommended internal workflows within a company (regulatory, quality, legal, operations) to ensure that all contract manufacturing arrangements remain synchronized with TFDA approvals?  
19. For foreign entrusted manufacturers, what additional due diligence should domestic entrusting parties perform to ensure sustained QMS compliance and data integrity over time?  
20. Are there planned enhancements to the Medical Device Contract Manufacturing Online Application System—such as APIs, dashboards, or validation tools—that applicants should anticipate and prepare for?
