## Part I – Workflow and Related Regulations

### 1. System Evolution and Optimization

Let’s start with the development history and recent optimization of the **Medical Device Registration Electronic Submission System**.

Over the last several years, TFDA has been progressively improving the system to support more types of applications:

- **Introduction of electronic submission for Class II and Class III devices (around Year 112)**  
  The system first began to provide electronic submission services for **Class II and Class III medical device registration**. This was an important step toward digitizing the regulatory process.

- **“Offline Version” application mode added (around Year 113)**  
  Recognizing that not all applicants have stable internet or may have large volumes of files, TFDA introduced an **offline mode**. Applicants can download a predefined folder structure, burn their application data to a CD, and then submit that CD together with paper originals.

- **Comprehensive upgrade of application process and interface (around Year 113)**  
  The workflows for **deficiency replies and supplementary submissions** were optimized, and the user interface was upgraded to be more intuitive and user-friendly, reducing common user errors.

- **Planned electronic submission for Class I (starting Year 114 / 2025)**  
  For 2025, TFDA is scheduled to **expand the system to support Class I medical device registration** via electronic submission. For now, Class I can only be submitted electronically when **combined** with Class II or III in the same application, but the longer-term plan is to open up standalone Class I applications as well.

- **Smart Application Mode from July 1, 2025**  
  Starting **July 1, 2025**, the system will provide a **Smart Application Mode** for Class II and III applications. This mode guides applicants through a structured set of questions—covering application type, product classification, risk class, similar or alternative products, and more—to help ensure that the correct regulatory path and document set are selected.

- **No need for separate official letters for supplementary submissions from July 1, 2025**  
  Also from **July 1, 2025**, when applicants respond to deficiency letters or submit supplementary information, **they will generally no longer need to attach separate official letters**, as long as **no other physical original documents** are required for that particular supplement.

For more information, you can always check the **TFDA official website**, especially the **Registration Zone**:

### 2. System Overview: How the Electronic Submission Works

Conceptually, the **Medical Device Registration Electronic Submission System** connects three main components:

1. **Medical Device Businesses**  
   These are the applicants: manufacturers, license holders, or authorized representatives seeking:
   - **New registration** for Class II or III devices  
   - **License change**  
   - **License extension**

2. **Electronic Submission Platform**  
   The platform is used for:
   - Online data entry  
   - Document upload (web mode)  
   - Generating submission forms and application forms  
   - Handling payments (online or counter-based)  
   - Managing deficiency replies and appeals  
   This system is supported by TFDA’s **information security infrastructure** and **data center**.

3. **Medical Device License Management System**  
   Once an application is reviewed and approved, the final information is synchronized with or reflected in the **license management system**, which holds the official records of **approved medical device licenses**.

The high-level flow is:

- Applicant prepares application materials  
- Applicant submits via **web mode** or **offline CD**  
- TFDA conducts **online review**  
- Applicant responds to any **deficiency notices**  
- TFDA issues **approval notification**  
- Approved license information is recorded in the license management system

### 3. Applicable Subjects and Scope

Now, let’s clarify **who can use this system** and **for what types of cases**.

#### Applicable Subjects

The system is intended for **medical device businesses** that are:

- Applying for **Class II or Class III medical device registration**  
- Applying for **license changes** (e.g., label changes, manufacturer changes, etc.) for Class II or III devices  
- Applying for **license extensions** for Class II or III devices

#### Scope of Application

- **Class II and Class III medical devices**  
  Registration, license change, and license extension for **Class II and III devices** can be processed entirely through the **electronic submission system**.

- **Class I devices**  
  Class I cases are **generally not yet covered** by this system, **unless** they are **submitted jointly** with Class II or III devices in a combined application.  
  Future planning (around **FY116, i.e., 2027**) includes **opening up full electronic submission for Class I** as well.

By moving applications online, TFDA aims both to **improve application efficiency** and to **support energy saving and carbon reduction**, by greatly reducing the amount of physical paper and postal traffic.

---

## Part III – Common Q&A for Case Application

Let’s now look at frequent questions and recent updates.

### 1. Submission Cover Sheet

- Always **download the “Submission Document Cover Sheet”** from the system.  
- Place it as the **first page** of your mailed package.  
- **Without a cover sheet, TFDA will not process your submission.**

This rule applies to **new applications**, **supplementary submissions**, **appeals**, and **other mailed materials** related to the case.

### 2. Data Entry: “Data Description” Field

- In each upload section, there is a **“Data Description”** field.  
- Please **briefly describe what each uploaded document contains**.  
  - For example: “Biocompatibility test report – ISO 10993-5 and 10993-10”  
- This **helps reviewers quickly understand** the content and speeds up the review process.  
- Do **not upload the same file multiple times** in different slots unless strictly necessary; **duplicate uploads** can cause confusion and inefficiency.

### 3. Supplementary Submissions and Appeals

When TFDA issues a **deficiency letter** or allows an **appeal**:

- Upload the supplementary documents or appeal materials via the **electronic submission system**.  
- It is recommended to **download a backup file** for your records.  
- Mail the **original documents (if required)** along with a **supplement/appeal cover sheet** to TFDA **within 3 working days** from the date of the electronic submission.  
- Again, **submissions without a cover sheet will not be accepted**.

For **case withdrawal**:

- Submit a **withdrawal request in the system**, and  
- Send a **formal letter** to TFDA, clearly stating:
  - The **system flow number** of the case  
  - The **reason for withdrawal**

### 4. Recent Regulatory & Process Updates

#### 4.1 Handling of Labeling, Instructions, and Packaging Drafts

- For **registration application cases**:  
  - Drafts of **labels**, **instructions**, or **packaging** can be **uploaded as scanned files** in the system.  
  - The **originals do not need to be mailed immediately**.  
  - However, when **collecting the license**, you must provide **two original copies** of the finalized labels/instructions/packaging drafts.

- For **change application cases**:  
  - You must mail:
    - The **original license certificate**  
    - The **original approved labels/instructions/packaging** that bear the central competent authority’s approval stamp (if applicable)  
    - Two copies of the **proposed new drafts** of labels/instructions/packaging (if applicable)  
    - All of this should be mailed together with the **Submission Document Cover Sheet**

#### 4.2 Mandatory Electronic Submission for Certain Case Types from July 1, 2025

Beginning **July 1, 2025**, for **Class II and III applications in certain categories**, **paper-only submissions are no longer accepted**. These categories include:

- Registration and change cases that **use preclinical test data alternatives**  
- Applications **exclusively for export**  
- **Same product with different names** – where the same device is marketed under multiple product names

For those categories, you **must use the electronic submission system**.

There is an exception:  
If, for **special reasons**, TFDA officially agrees to allow **paper-based submission**, the applicant must:

- Obtain a **consent letter from TFDA**  
- Attach a **copy of this consent letter** to **each** paper-based application  
- Note that the **consent letter is valid for 3 years**.

If an applicant **fails to use the electronic system when required** and **does not attach a valid consent letter**:

- For **registration applications**, the case will **fail formal review**.  
- For **change applications**, the case will be **returned and refunded**.

#### 4.3 Supplementary Submissions – No Additional Official Letters (from July 1, 2025)

From **July 1, 2025**, for many supplementary submissions:

- **Additional official letters will generally not be required**, as long as **no other physical original documents** must be attached.  
- This significantly simplifies the **supplement/deficiency reply process** and reduces paperwork.

---

## System Improvement: Smart Application Mode

One of the key new features is the **Smart Application Mode** (智慧申請模式) for **Class II and III**.

When you click on **“Smart Application Class II/III”**, a structured pop-up form appears, asking for key information:

1. **Application Method**  
2. **Case Type**, such as:
   - General application  
   - Same product, different name  
   - Exclusively for export  
   - Reapplication within six months after the license expiration date

3. **Product Category**  
4. **Class** (II or III)  
5. **Risk Class**  
6. **Presence of Similar Products**  
7. **Presence of Alternative Products**  
8. **Classification Item** (specific category within the classification scheme)  
9. **Manufacturer Information**  
10. **Product Characteristics**  
11. **Use of Alternative Mode** (e.g., use of preclinical test data in lieu of certain studies, where applicable)

By filling out this information, the system can:

- Help you choose the **correct regulatory path**  
- Pre-select or suggest **required document lists**  
- Reduce classification errors and omissions

This mode is particularly useful for:

- Complex products  
- Cases involving **alternative data modes**

## 20 Comprehensive Follow-up Questions

1. Which specific Class II or III products in your current portfolio do you plan to transition to the electronic submission system first, and what are their main regulatory challenges?
2. How are you currently managing the generation, sealing, and color scanning of system-generated application forms, and do you foresee any bottlenecks in that process?
3. Do you have internal SOPs that clearly distinguish when to use web mode versus offline CD mode, and how do you decide between them?
4. What internal controls do you have in place to ensure that all mailed packages always include the correct Submission Document Cover Sheet on the first page?
5. How are you organizing and labeling your electronic files to consistently comply with the 50 MB limit and searchable PDF requirement?
6. Are your Chinese instruction manuals and labeling drafts already maintained as editable Word files, or would you need to adapt your document management practices?
7. How do you plan to verify whether a document’s electronic signature fully complies with the Electronic Signature Act, so that you can safely omit paper originals?
8. What is your current process for tracking the 3-working-day deadline between electronic submission and mailing of original documents, and how will you monitor compliance?
9. Have you evaluated whether your upcoming applications fall into the categories that must use electronic submission from July 1, 2025 (e.g., preclinical data alternatives, export-only, same product–different name)?
10. In cases where you might require paper-based submission due to special circumstances, how will you manage the acquisition, storage, and use of TFDA consent letters within their 3-year validity?
11. How do you intend to use the Smart Application Mode to reduce classification or documentation errors, and who in your team will be responsible for configuring those inputs?
12. Are your staff members familiar with logging in via the Business Certificate IC Card, and do you have a contingency plan if the card is lost, damaged, or expires?
13. How will you internally train regulatory and RA staff to use the “Data Description” field effectively so that it genuinely accelerates TFDA’s review?
14. What is your current strategy for responding to deficiency letters and managing supplementary submissions, including ensuring timely uploads and mailing (when originals are required)?
15. Do you maintain a central registry or dashboard of all ongoing TFDA cases (new, change, extension, supplement, appeal, withdrawal) that aligns with the statuses shown in the electronic submission system?
16. How will you integrate the timing and reconciliation of online or counter payments into your internal project timelines to avoid delays in clicking “Submit Application”?
17. Are there any internal IT or security policies that might restrict your ability to use the TFDA system (e.g., firewalls, browser restrictions), and how will you coordinate with your IT department?
18. Have you designated clear contact points within your organization for interacting with TFDA’s regulatory consultation hotline and the system operation consultation service?
19. How do you plan to update your quality management system (QMS) documentation, including SOPs and work instructions, to reflect the mandatory electronic submission requirements effective July 1, 2025?
20. Over the next 12–24 months, what metrics (e.g., approval time, number of deficiencies, resubmission rate) will you track to measure the effectiveness of your transition to the electronic submission system?
